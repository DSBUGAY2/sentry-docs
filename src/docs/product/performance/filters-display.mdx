There are several ways you can filter the information displayed on the **Performance** page, by using search or various page-level display filters.

## Transaction and Trend Views

Using the “By Transaction/By Trend” toggle, you can set the overall display of the page. By default, the page is set to view transactions and the different ways that you can filter and set the display of transactions is described in the rest of this page. Learn more about viewing transactions by trend in the [Trends View documentation](/product/performance/trends/).

## Search Condition Filters

The search bar operates similarly to the one in the Discover [Query Builder](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/#filter-by-search-conditions). For example, you can refine your transaction search to a specific release by using `release:` as a key field and assigning the version as a value.

## Display Filter

The "Display" filter can be found next to the search bar. This  automatically selects a set of [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) and table columns based on the platform of your project. For example, a JavaScript project defaults to a Frontend (Pageload) display. You can change the selected display, but some modes may not be applicable to the platform.

### All Transactions

When "All Transactions" is selected, the table includes all frontend and backend transactions.

### Frontend (Pageload)

"Frontend (Pageload)" puts an emphasis on [Web Vitals](/product/performance/web-vitals/). The transactions are automatically filtered to only include `transaction.op:pageload`. This generally corresponds to all browser page transitions that are not handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue.

### Frontend (Other)

"Frontend (Other)" includes any other frontend transaction that is not a pageload. The filter `transaction.op:!pageload` automatically gets added. This generally corresponds to page transitions handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue. Note that if you've selected a backend project, this mode also displays backend transactions.

### Backend

"Backend" puts an emphasis on duration, throughput, failure rate, and Apdex. Note that if you've selected a frontend project, this mode also displays all frontend transactions.

## Graphs

You can compare graphs side by side to find any relevant correlations. For example, if an Apdex score dips significantly during a given time period, you'll be able to visualize whether throughput spiked in the same time interval in a "Transactions per Minute" graph. The global header and search conditions will also allow you to filter these graphs even more. The display options are listed below:

- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Transactions Per Minute (TPM)](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- [Failure Rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [p50 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p50-threshold)
- [p95 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p95-threshold)
- [p99 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p99-threshold)

## Transaction Table

The table of transactions provides you with a list of the most frequent transactions based on the current page filters and display options. By default, the table is sorted by transactions per minute, with the most frequent transactions displayed first. The table may be filtered further based on global header and search condition filters.
The [Display Filter](/product/performance/display-filters/#display-filter) will automatically set what appears in the table columns. Here are a few of the common columns shown in the tables.

- Transaction Name
- Project
- Operation
- [TPM](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- [P50](/product/performance/metrics/#average-transaction-duration)
- [P95](/product/performance/metrics/#p95-threshold)
- [Failure Rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- Unique Users
- [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery)

If you have transactions you frequently return to, you can mark up to 10 transactions as a key transaction by clicking the star in the corresponding row. Clicking the star ensures that these key transactions are always surfaced to the top of the list. You can also mark a transaction as a key transaction in its corresponding [summary view](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#key-transaction).

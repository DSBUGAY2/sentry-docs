The Symfony SDK offers integrations that support distributed tracing, including database queries, Twig template rendering, and cache pools. These integrations are disabled by default to avoid adding unexpected overhead to your services.

To use them, you need to use the latest version of the SDK and add the specific integration as illustrated below:

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: true
    cache:
      enabled: true
    twig: # templating engine
      enabled: true
```

### Dbal

This integration supports tracking database queries as Spans. Enabling this option will create Spans for you queries.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: true
```

### twig

This integration adds distributed tracing for Twig template rendering using Sentry.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    twig: # DB queries
      enabled: true
```

### cache

This integration adds support for distributed tracing of cache pools.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    cache: # DB queries
      enabled: true
```

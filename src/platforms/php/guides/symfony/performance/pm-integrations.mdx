The Symfony SDK offers integrations that support distributed tracing, including database queries, Twig template rendering, and cache pools. These integrations are disabled by default to avoid adding unexpected overhead to your services.

To use them, you need to use the latest version of the SDK and add the specific integration as illustrated below:

<--TODO: add samples to code snippet -->

```Env
###> sentry/sentry-symfony ###
SENTRY_DSN="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0"
//add lines here to illustrate how these integrations work

###< sentry/sentry-symfony ###
```

### Dbal

This integration supports tracking database queries as Spans. Enabling this option will disable `DbalLogger` which is often used to log queries to Monolog.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.

### twig

This integration adds distributed tracing for Twig template rendering using Sentry.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.

### cache

This integration adds support for distributed tracing of cache pools.

It is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enabled` to `true`.
